// Per-review switches set in review.json under `features`. A switch left out is on, so a review
// that sets nothing keeps every part of the app. The grey literature review sets
// `document_view: false` (PI ruling 1, 10 October 2026): it is a coding review only.
//   screen         the Screen tab (full-text screening)
//   documents      the Documents tab and document pages
//   code           the Code tab
//   verify         the Verify tab (verifying existing coding)
//   document_view  Verify by document: full text, coded fragments, new codes and comments on selected text
//   pdf            the Open PDF button beside each item
//   agreement      the Agreement tab (agreement between coders)
//   overview       the Overview tab
//   themes_by_document  Themes, by document: documents by sub-question, the PDF beside the fragments
//   themes_by_code      Themes, by theme: every fragment for one code across documents
//   reporting      the Reporting tab: the outputs ticked on the set-up page (review.json `reporting.outputs`)
// The two themes switches are off unless the review sets them to true, and need a "themes" block in
// review.json (themes.js). They were added for the cognitive impairment review's paragraph-level coding
// (PI, 13 October 2026), so no other review gains a tab.
// A team repo can start with some parts off and switch them on later, in the same repo, once their
// data is added: cogimp-team starts with the Project page and Screen only (PI, 11 October 2026).
// `reporting` is off unless the review sets it to true, like the themes switches, so no review set up before the
// set-up page gains a tab (PI, 13 October 2026). It needs no other block.
